= Infrastructure

== Azure

To deploy the Azure infrastructure, you need to have an Azure account and the Azure CLI installed.
Then, execute the following scripts:

```bash
./azure-setup-azure-env.sh      # Create the Azure resources
./azure-build-push-registry.sh  # Build and push the Docker images to the Azure Container Registry
./azure-setup-aca-env.sh        # Create the Azure Container Apps resources
./azure-deploy-aca.sh           # Deploys the application to Azure Container Apps
```
